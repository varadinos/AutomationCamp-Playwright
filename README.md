## Features

- **End-to-End Automation** using Playwright.
- **Page Object Model (POM) Design** for better maintainability.
- **TypeScript Support** for strong typing and better code quality.
- **Playwright Test Runner** for running and managing test cases.
- **Fixtures Implementation** for reusable test setup.
- **Assertions with Expect API** for validation.
- **GitHub Actions:** Integrates continuous integration workflows using GitHub Actions.â€‹


## Installation

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:

```sh
npx playwright test
```

### Run a specific test:

```sh
npx playwright test tests/advanced.spec.ts
```

### Run tests in headed mode:

```sh
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Generate and view reports:

```sh
npx playwright test --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

## Writing Tests

- Test cases are located inside the `tests` folder.
- Page object files are inside the `pages` folder.
- Fixtures are located in the `setup` folder.
- Helper scripts are located in the `utils` folder.
- Test data is located in the `data` folder.

### Example Test (Using Fixtures and POM)

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../setup/fixtures';
import { AdvancedTopicsPage } from "../pages/AdvancedTopicsPage";

test('Verify book rating submission displays Well done message', async ({ advancedTopicsPage }) => {
    await advancedTopicsPage.setStarRatingValue(advancedTopicsPage.starRating);
    await advancedTopicsPage.checkRatingButton.click();
    await expect(advancedTopicsPage.wellDoneLabel).toBeVisible();
    await expect(advancedTopicsPage.wellDoneLabel).toHaveText('Well done!');
});
```

### Example Fixtures Setup (`fixtures.ts`)

```typescript
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import playwright from 'playwright';
import { HomePage } from '../pages/HomePage';
import { AdvancedTopicsPage } from '../pages/AdvancedTopicsPage';

type Fixtures = {
    homePage: HomePage;
    advancedTopicsPage: AdvancedTopicsPage;
};

export const test = base.extend<Fixtures>({
    browser: async ({}, use) => {
        const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({ headless: false, args: ['--start-maximized'] });
        await use(browser);
        await browser.close();
    },
    page: async ({ browser }, use) => {
        const page = await browser.newPage();
        page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1040 });
        await use(page);
        await page.close();
    },
    homePage: async ({ page }, use) => {
        const homePage = new HomePage();
        await use(homePage);
    },
    advancedTopicsPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
        const advancedTopicsPage = new AdvancedTopicsPage(page);
        advancedTopicsPage.goTo();
        await use(advancedTopicsPage);
    }
});

export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
```
